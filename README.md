# CS-330

1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
How to visualize items abstractly
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
I would start with the base shape that closely matches the objects and then keep breaking it down into smaller items
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Whether you’re making 3d objects or design a database a structured approach can make any task possible,
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Not design but reading code and using hits from the existing code to find out what libraries the code exists in.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?
I would always take the time to review much of the provided code as needed to understand it. This would give me an idea of how to work with the code provided and what will need to be made from scratch
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
First do some research to gain basic understanding so your prepared when starting to understand the existing code.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
CS teaches you to look past what you see in front of you and to approach problems systematically like with algorithms.
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Having a basic understanding of all aspects will help to not only choose a discipline but give us key insight when developing code and how it affects the greater picture
